# The Web Dev Index

This is a personal project of mine. I plan on building up my knowledge on the fundamentals
of web development, and I thought that making some notes plus related projects would be an
engaging way of doing so.


## Infrastructure

Everything that web development is directly built upon: internet protocols, the DNS, proxies, etc.

- [ ] Sockets
- [ ] HTTP(S)
- [ ] TCP/IP
- [ ] TLS/SSL
- [ ] Domain Name System (DNS)
- [ ] Reverse proxies
- [ ] Web servers


## Basic tasks of a web app

Tasks that most web applications must implement one way or another. Managing
static files, media, parsing files from requests, etc. Things that are excessively
tied to implementation details.

- [ ] Data parsing
- [ ] File parsing
- [ ] Static files
- [ ] Common security measures
