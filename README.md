# The Web Dev Index

This is a personal project of mine. I plan on building up my knowledge on the fundamentals
of web development, and I thought that making some notes plus related projects would be an
engaging way of doing so.


## Infrastructure

Everything that web development is directly built upon: internet protocols, the DNS, proxies, etc.

- [ ] Sockets
- [ ] HTTP(S)
- [ ] TCP/IP
- [ ] TLS/SSL
- [ ] Domain Name System (DNS)
- [ ] Reverse proxies
- [ ] Web servers


## Basic tasks of a web app

Tasks that most web applications must implement one way or another. Managing
static files, media, parsing files from requests, etc. Things that are excessively
tied to implementation details.

- [ ] Data parsing
- [ ] File parsing
- [ ] Static files
- [ ] Common security measures


## Website

One half of the project is going to be about creating beautiful reference notes. The main
objective is to have a quick way of remembering how any of the topics that I research work.
This is in contrast to indepth notes, which I will also be taking, but will be more of a
secondary thing.

I plan on making the website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is a technology
that I'm curious about, but I might change this decision later.

The website is located on the `site/` directory in this same repository.
